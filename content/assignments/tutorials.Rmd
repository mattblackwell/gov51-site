## Installing the QSS tutorials pacakge

To install the package that contains the tutorials for the class run the following lines of code:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
remotes::install_github("rstudio/learnr")
remotes::install_github("rstudio-education/gradethis")
remotes::install_github("mattblackwell/qsslearnr")
```

After the package has been installed, you should be able to find all of the tutorials for the course in the "Tutorials" tab in the top-right pane of RStudio. Scroll down to find a QSS tutorial and click "Start Tutorial" to launch a tutorial:

## Submission Reports

Once you have completed the tutorial you will see a screen that prompts you to enter your name and produce a submission report. Clicking "Download" should place a report into the folder of your choosing. Find that PDF and upload it Gradescope (see the link at the top of every page).

Note that we do not grade these reports on correctness, just that you attempted the entire tutorial. That said, going slowly and making sure that you understand each question and its answer is a good practice to ensure you are mastering the course material.
